To ensure that a sequential `id` column (e.g., primary key or auto-increment) is **not broken** and to **find missing numbers** in SQL, you can use a few techniques depending on your database system. Here's a general approach that works across most SQL dialects:

---

## ðŸ§® 1. Detect Missing IDs Using a Sequence Generator

You can generate a full range of expected IDs and compare it to the actual ones.

### âœ… Example using a Common Table Expression (CTE):

```sql
WITH expected_ids AS (
    SELECT generate_series(
        (SELECT MIN(id) FROM your_table),
        (SELECT MAX(id) FROM your_table)
    ) AS id
)
SELECT e.id
FROM expected_ids e
LEFT JOIN your_table t ON e.id = t.id
WHERE t.id IS NULL;
```

- `generate_series()` is available in **PostgreSQL**.
- This returns all `id`s that **should exist** but are **missing**.

---

## ðŸ§® 2. Alternative for MySQL (no `generate_series`)

You can simulate a sequence using a helper table or recursive CTE (MySQL 8+):

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE expected_ids AS (
    SELECT MIN(id) AS id FROM your_table
    UNION ALL
    SELECT id + 1 FROM expected_ids
    WHERE id < (SELECT MAX(id) FROM your_table)
)
SELECT e.id
FROM expected_ids e
LEFT JOIN your_table t ON e.id = t.id
WHERE t.id IS NULL;
```

- This works in **MySQL 8+**, **SQL Server**, and **SQLite** (with slight syntax tweaks).
- It builds a list of expected IDs and finds gaps.

---

## ðŸ§® 3. Check for Gaps Between Consecutive Rows

If you just want to detect where gaps occur:

```sql
SELECT t1.id + 1 AS missing_id
FROM your_table t1
LEFT JOIN your_table t2 ON t1.id + 1 = t2.id
WHERE t2.id IS NULL
ORDER BY t1.id;
```

- This finds **single missing IDs** between existing rows.
- Works in most SQL dialects.

---

## ðŸ§® 4. Count and Compare

To verify if the sequence is complete:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS actual_count,
       MAX(id) - MIN(id) + 1 AS expected_count
FROM your_table;
```

- If `actual_count < expected_count`, you have missing IDs.
